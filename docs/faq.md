## Do I need any prior coding experience to benefit from the camp?
No, you don’t! We offer two levels of camp. The Foundation A & B camps are for those who don’t know programming. Without coding, students will still be able to develop AI applications to solve real-world problems!

## What is your cancellation policy?
We fully understand that sometimes plans may change. We will honor a FULL refund, except a 3% processing fee chargd by the third-party payment system, if the request to cancel is submitted at least A WEEK prior to your scheduled camp start date. You just need to email us at [info@aicampcenter.org](mailto:info@aicampcenter.org). We're committed to making this process as straightforward as possible for you. We will give 50% refund within one week of the camp start date, and no refund after the camp starts. 

## Do you offer any financial aid or scholarships for your programs?
Limited financial aid or scholarships are possible. For 2025 camps, the application is due at 6/15/2025. You will need to email us at [info@aicampcenter.org](mailto:info@aicampcenter.org) by two weeks before then. The selection will be based on the financial background of the student and how well a student might benefit from our program based on their responses to essay questions in the application.
