# FAQ

## Do I need any prior coding experience to benefit from the camp?
No you don’t! We offer two levels of camp. The NL and AL camps are for those who don’t know programming. Without coding, students will still be able to develop AI applications to solve real-world problems!

## What is your cancellation policy?
We fully understand that sometimes plans may change. We will honor a FULL refund if the request to cancel is submitted at least TWO WEEKS prior to your scheduled camp start date. You just need to email us at info@smartharmony.net. We're committed to making this process as straightforward as possible for you.

## Do you offer any financial aid or scholarships for your programs?
Limited financial aid or scholarships are possible. Please email us at info@smartharmony.net at least THREE WEEKS prior to your scheduled camp start date. The selection will be based on the financial background of the student and how well a student might benefit from our program based on their responses to essay questions in the application.
