## Do I need any prior coding experience to benefit from the camp?
No, you don’t! We offer two levels of camp. The Foundation A & B camps are for those who don’t know programming. Without coding, students will still be able to develop AI applications to solve real-world problems!

## What is your cancellation policy?
We fully understand that sometimes plans may change. We will honor a FULL refund if the request to cancel is submitted at least TWO WEEKS prior to your scheduled camp start date. You just need to email us at [info@aicampcenter.org](mailto:info@aicampcenter.org). We're committed to making this process as straightforward as possible for you.

## Do you offer any financial aid or scholarships for your programs?
Limited financial aid or scholarships are possible. Please email us at [info@aicampcenter.org](mailto:info@aicampcenter.org) at least THREE WEEKS prior to your scheduled camp start date. The selection will be based on the financial background of the student and how well a student might benefit from our program based on their responses to essay questions in the application.
